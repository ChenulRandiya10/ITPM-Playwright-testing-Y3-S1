# ITPM Playwright Test Suite

**Short description**

This repository contains a Playwright test suite that validates the Singlish-to-Sinhala translation service on https://www.swifttranslator.com/. Tests include functional positive and negative scenarios, UI smoke checks, and example tests. Test artifacts (HTML report and screenshots) are generated by Playwright.

---

## Features

- Tests written with `@playwright/test` (v1.58+)
- Tests grouped into: `positive`, `negative`, `ui`, and `example` specs
- Screenshots saved to `screenshots/`
- HTML report produced to `playwright-report/`
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (recommended) installed
- Git (optional)
- Internet access (tests navigate to `https://www.swifttranslator.com/`)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChenulRandiya10/ITPM-Playwright-testing-Y3-S1.git
   cd ITPM-Playwright-testing-Y3-S1
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers (required once):

   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

---

## Running tests locally

- Run the full test suite:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Run tests for a single spec file:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/negative.spec.js
  ```

- Run a particular test by name (uses a name/regex match):

  ```bash
  npx playwright test -g "Neg_Fun_0001"
  ```

- Run tests for a specific Playwright project/browser (configured in `playwright.config.js`):

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --project=chromium
  ```

- Show HTML report after running tests:

  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report
  ```

---

## Test structure & conventions

- Test directory: `tests/`
- `positive.spec.js` and `negative.spec.js` contain arrays of scenario objects with `id`, `name`, `input`, and `expected` fields.
- Tests navigate to `https://www.swifttranslator.com/`, inject input into the placeholder `Input Your Singlish Text Here.` and assert against the page's output element `div.whitespace-pre-wrap.overflow-y-auto`.
- Each scenario saves a screenshot at `screenshots/<SCENARIO_ID>.png`.

---

## Artifacts

- Screenshots: `screenshots/` (saved by tests)
- HTML report: `playwright-report/` (generated automatically by the `html` reporter)

---

## Continuous Integration

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`. It:

- installs dependencies
- installs Playwright browsers
- runs `npx playwright test`
- uploads `playwright-report/` as an artifact

---

## Contributing

- Add new scenarios to `positive.spec.js` or `negative.spec.js` following the same object structure.
- Keep each test deterministic and avoid external dependencies where possible.
- If adding a new spec file, ensure it follows the conventions in `playwright.config.js`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If tests time out, verify network access to `https://www.swifttranslator.com/` and increase test timeouts if needed.
- If Playwright browsers are missing, re-run: `npx playwright install`.
- For CI-specific issues, check `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` and the job logs on GitHub Actions.

## Useful commands (suggested package.json scripts)

You may add the following to `package.json` "scripts" for convenience:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "npx playwright test",
  "test:headed": "npx playwright test --headed",
  "report": "npx playwright show-report"
}
```
